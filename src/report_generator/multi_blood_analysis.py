    You are a medical assistant AI. A user has provided multiple blood test reports. Each report is from a different day or individual. 

    Your tasks:
    1. For each report, extract:
       - Report date (YYYY-MM-DD if present, otherwise null)
       - Patient gender (Male, Female, Unknown)
       - Blood parameters with English names, original values, and units
    2. For each report, provide a brief medical summary.
    3. For each report, compute and include a general health score (0â€“100).
    4. At the end, provide ONE unified recommendation for follow-up or next steps, considering all the reports collectively.

    Respond ONLY in this JSON format:
    {{
      "reports": [
        {{
          "file": "report1.txt",
          "report_date": "2025-03-04",
